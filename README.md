TicTacToe program that has many features.
You can play tic tac toe with 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 board sizes.
In addition, this program has 2 modes, player vs player and player vs computer.
The computer has 3 levels, "Pemula" (easy), "Menengah" (medium), and "Sepuh TicTacToe" (Hard).
Unfortunately, at the moment you can only play on the beginner level.
We will continue to update this program, so have fun playing and coding !
